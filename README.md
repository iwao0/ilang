> 🦀 **ARC** memory safety · ⚡ **MIR → Cranelift JIT** · 🔬 **leak checks built in** · 🔗 **C FFI** · 🎮 ships with an **SDL2 game demo**

A compiler/runtime for **ilang**, a young programming language
under active design. MIR-based Cranelift JIT for fast cold-start
*and* fast steady-state, ARC for deterministic destruction (no
GC pauses), and a Rust-flavoured surface syntax that talks to C
libraries when you need to.

```rust
fn fib(n: i64): i64 {
    if n < 2 { n } else { fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2) }
}
console.log(fib(20))    // → 6765
```

## 🔬 Leak checks are first-class

Most languages need a separate tool for memory hygiene —
Valgrind, ASan, Xcode Instruments, a heap-snapshot diff. ilang
exposes the allocator counter through the standard `test`
module, so a leak assertion is *just another `expect`*:

```rust
use test

let baseline = test.liveAllocBytes()

let i = 0
while i < 1000 {
    let _ = "x" + i.toString()   // intermediate strings, fresh heap
    i = i + 1
}

// All that intermediate heap should be reclaimed by now.
test.expectTrue(test.liveAllocBytes() - baseline < 1024)
```

`test.liveAllocBytes()` / `liveAllocCount()` / `liveStringCount()`
report what the runtime is currently holding. The fixture suite
under [`tests/programs/05_edge_cases/leak_*.il`](crates/ilang-cli/tests/programs/05_edge_cases/)
uses this pattern to lock down per-construct memory contracts —
30+ fixtures across string concat, array push, closure cells,
enum payloads, map deletions, weak upgrades, and more.

This is the part of ilang we think is genuinely uncommon: every
PR runs its leak tests automatically, no external tooling, no
sampling profiler, no environment setup.

## ✨ Vision

- 🛡️ **Capability-based security** — libraries and classes carry
  permissions like `net`, `file`; the host grants them at use sites
  to reduce supply-chain blast radius. *(annotations parse today;
  enforcement is the next big milestone)*
- 🦀 **ARC** for memory safety — no ownership / `mut` / borrow
  checker.
- 🦀 **Rust-flavoured** declarations and type names.
- 🌐 **C / JavaScript** arithmetic semantics (operator precedence,
  integer-promotion behaviour).

## 📚 Syntax cheatsheet

The implemented syntax / types / built-ins are catalogued in
**[docs/syntax.md](docs/syntax.md)**.

## ✅ Status

| Category | Status |
| --- | :---: |
| Numeric types (i8–i64 / u8–u64 / f32 / f64) + `as` casts | ✅ |
| `bool` / comparison / short-circuit logic | ✅ |
| `let` / assignment / compound assignment (`+=` and friends) | ✅ |
| Control flow (`if` / `else` / `while` / `loop` / `break` / `continue` / early `return`) | ✅ |
| Strings / arrays (dynamic & fixed-length) | ✅ |
| `class` / `new` / `init` / `this` / `deinit` (JS-style) | ✅ |
| Inheritance (`extends` / `super`) + virtual dispatch | ✅ |
| `console.log` | ✅ |
| Optional (`T?` / `some` / `none` / `if let`) | ✅ |
| Weak references (`T.weak` / `.get()`) | ✅ |
| `enum` + `match` (with built-in `Result<T, E>`) | ✅ |
| `Map<K, V>` / Tuple | ✅ |
| Closures (with capture) | ✅ |
| Generics (functions / classes / enums) | ✅ |
| Function overloading | ✅ |
| ARC-based memory management | ✅ |
| Type checking | ✅ |
| MIR → Cranelift JIT (`ilang run`, default) | ✅ |
| Built-in leak helpers (`test.liveAllocBytes` / `liveAllocCount` / `liveStringCount`) | ✅ |
| FFI (`@extern(C) {}` blocks calling C libraries) | ✅ |
| Capability annotations | 🚧 parse-only |

No ownership / `mut` / borrow checker — every variable is
reassignable. Errors are emitted in the uniform
`filename [row:col]: message` format.

## 🔧 Setup

ilang is implemented in Rust, so you'll need a **Rust toolchain**
(rustup / cargo). If it isn't installed, grab it from
<https://rustup.rs>:

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Clone the repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/iwao0/ilang
cd ilang
cargo build           # first run resolves deps + compiles (~1 minute)
```

## 🚀 Usage

```sh
# 💬 REPL — let / fn persist across lines, JIT-backed
cargo run -p ilang-cli

# 📄 Run a file (`;` is optional, newlines act as statement separators
#    JS-ASI style). Defaults to the MIR → Cranelift JIT pipeline.
cargo run -p ilang-cli -- run path/to/script.il

# 🪦 Legacy Cranelift codegen (pre-MIR), retained only as a parity
#    reference for the test harness — deprecated for new use.
cargo run -p ilang-cli -- run --jit path/to/script.il
```

Both backends resolve `@extern(C) {}` C symbols through dlsym at
JIT-build time, so the SDL2 sample below works under either flag.

### 🧮 Sample: count multiples of 3 or 5 from 1 to 100

```sh
cat > sample.il <<'EOF'
fn count_div(n: i64): i64 {
    let i = 1
    let count = 0
    while i <= n {
        if i % 3 == 0 || i % 5 == 0 {
            count = count + 1
        }
        i = i + 1
    }
    count
}
count_div(100)
EOF
cargo run -p ilang-cli -- run sample.il   # => 47
```

### 🧱 Classes

JS-flavoured objects with `class` / `new` / `init` (constructor) /
`this`. Inside method bodies you can omit `this.` for fields and
methods (a local or parameter of the same name still wins).

```sh
cat > counter.il <<'EOF'
class Counter {
    count: i64
    init(start: i64) { this.count = start }
    bump(): i64 {
        count += 1     // same as `this.count += 1`
        count
    }
}

let c = new Counter(10)
let i = 0
loop {
    if i >= 5 { break }
    c.bump()
    i += 1
}
c.bump()
EOF
cargo run -p ilang-cli -- run counter.il   # => 16
```

### 🎮 Sample: an SDL2 game window

`examples/sdl_breakout/` contains an SDL2 demo: a neon-style
breakout game with paddle, bricks, particles, and gamepad support.
Arrow keys / `A` `D` (or D-pad / left stick) move the paddle,
`Space` launches the ball, `F` toggles fullscreen, `R` restarts
after game over, `ESC` quits.

Install SDL2 first:

```sh
# 🍎 macOS (Homebrew)
brew install sdl2

# 🐧 Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-2.0-0
```

Run:

```sh
cargo run -p ilang-cli -- run --jit examples/sdl_breakout/main.il
```

The sample pulls in the SDL2 bindings under `bindings/sdl2/` via a
plain `use sdl`. The mechanism (an `ilang.toml` with a `[deps]`
table) is documented in
[bindings/sdl2/README.md](bindings/sdl2/README.md).

To use the SDL2 bindings from your own project, drop an
`ilang.toml` next to (or above) your entry file:

```toml
[package]
name = "my_game"

[deps]
sdl2 = "/path/to/ilang/bindings/sdl2"
```

The CLI walks upward from the entry file looking for `ilang.toml`
at startup; each `[deps]` value becomes an additional search
directory for `use module` resolution.

## 🧩 VSCode

`vscode-extension/` ships syntax highlighting plus a language
server (`ilang-lsp`) for diagnostics, hover, and go-to-definition.
Local install:

```sh
# 1. Build the language server
cargo build -p ilang-lsp

# 2. Build the extension client
cd vscode-extension
npm install
npm run compile

# 3. Symlink into VSCode's extensions directory
ln -s "$(pwd)" ~/.vscode/extensions/ilang
```

Restart VSCode. See
[vscode-extension/README.md](vscode-extension/README.md) for
configuration (`ilang.serverPath`) and current limitations.

## 🛠️ Development

Run the whole test suite — Rust unit tests across every crate plus
the language-level fixtures under
`crates/ilang-cli/tests/programs/` (each `.il` fixture is executed
through both the default MIR → Cranelift JIT and the legacy `--jit`
backend, with `expect:` / `expect-error:` magic comments asserting
the outcome):

```sh
cargo test --workspace
```
